* [Rails]()
* [Git]()
* [Javascript]()

## Hide level guideliness

* Be consistent, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style
* The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying it
* Follow your :heart:
